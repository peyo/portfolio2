            I learned and used Apollo Client and Server, GraphQL, and Sequelize for the first time. I found it relatively easy to replace REST API calls with Mutations and Queries. I havenâ€™t used GraphQL enough to have a well-informed opinion, but I prefer it over REST API calls at the surface level. I also learned it was quite convenient to update data using `update` in the useMutation function with the `writeFragment` function.<br /><br />

            I saw the benefits of using Material UI to create a design system. Writing code that influences design within the same file can help the developer find the controlling code block quickly. Also, using Material UI documentation and resources created a more consistent and universal way of writing code.
